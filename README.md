# AngularJS kata using TypeScript

This kata aims to create a [_Memory_ game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29).
We decided to write an [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) application with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.

The main advantages to choose this language are:
- having a typed language which can avoid runtime issues
- having a testable application
- learn about Typescript before Angular 2 is out of beta 

You should follow all steps describe [here](#) to use this kata properly.
